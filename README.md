# Refactoring of a Java Card simulator on a Node.js platform

This project was produced as a MSc Dissertation and serves as a refactoring of a previous BSc Dissertation by Adam Noakes.

The original project is available at: https://github.com/adamnoakes/javacard-simulator.

The original project provided an open platform for the simulation of Java Card applets using Node.js. This project refactored the simulator by:

   - upgrading the original simulator with asynchronous functionalities, using new asynchronous features in ES2016
   - extending the original simulator to execute Java Card code byte-by-byte on Chrome browser
